/*
The default starting code for an arduino code file
Two required functions:
- void setup()
- void loop()

NOTE:
These two functions are required even if we are not planning to use them
*/

// This function is called only one time when the application starts
// Used for initializing input and output pins to make them ready for using
void setup()

{
    // Put your setup code here, to run once:
}

// This function runs repeatedly until the arduino is powered off
// It's used for the main code of our program
void loop()
{
    // Put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
